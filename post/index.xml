      <description>In these past few weeks I started doing the state of the art, I also created the index for the thesis and a table to summarize the type of sensors most of autonomous vehicles usually have.
In the other hand, I tested the cameras in rviz that had a little problem based on the pc using the ubuntu 20.04.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to create a Gantt Chart to organize my days based on what I need to do.</description>

      <description>This time I started testing the sensors :
 Sick LMS151 LIDAR Point grey Flea2 camera Sick LD MRS LIDAR  Starting with the first in the list:
I had some difficulties in testing this sensor because I changed the IP address of the LIDAR when testing it with the SOPAS enginnering tool in Windows, so I needed to change it back. After that it was only needed to create a static IP address in the range of the IP of the LIDAR and run the roslaunch file.</description>

      <description>This week I learned to see the sensors_msg in rviz, like LaserScan, images, PointCloud and markers. With this step I can start testing the sensors of the ATLASCAR2 next week.
I&amp;rsquo;m also almost done with the Readme file to turn on everything in the car.</description>

      <description>These past weeks I focused in learning ROS. In short, ROS (Robot Operating System) is a software to help developers create robot applications. So learning it is a very important step because ROS is the base of this thesis
For now I learned about messages, services, parameters and how to use ROS for my advantage.</description>

      <description>This week I tested the Sick LIDAR that are placed in the front of the car. To accomplish that I used the software &amp;ldquo;SOPAS engineering tool&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>For the first task in this project, I was asked to organize and label the cables of the ATLASCAR2. The objective of this task was to understand the electric connections of the car, which were very mangled and hard to decipher.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture to exemplify the state of the car:
  After some time in that jungle of wires, I made my way to the end. With time, the final result can be even better.</description>
